Signal Processing is an advanced research area that includes wide range of applications. Audio processing is one among this, which has wide research prospects - especially in the latest technology trend that includes Smart Homes and Smart Cities. One such research area would be Elderly care. One of the most important requirement here would be the accurate detection and recognition of different sounds. In this dissertation, we are focussing on creating an Autonomous Monitoring System. A low-cost, sound detection and decision making system is made using readily available low-cost hardware and sensors and its performance is analysed under various test scenarios. Privacy is the main concern in monitoring especially when used inside a home. Also, humans are expensive and not so reliable. Hence, we are designing a Sound based monitoring system which records only the sound and not video.


To run the code:

For pre-recorded files, use the file 'new'

To compile: gcc new.c -o new -lpython2.7 -lm -L/usr/lib/python2.7/config/ -I/usr/include/python2.7/

For recording using USB, use 'record'

To compile: gcc record.c -o record -lpython2.7 -lm -L/usr/lib/python2.7/config/ -I/usr/include/python2.7/
